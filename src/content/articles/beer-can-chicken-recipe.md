## The Ultimate Backyard Classic

Beer can chicken produces incredibly juicy meat with crispy, flavorful skin. Using NA beer means everyone at the cookout can enjoy it - and the chicken still gets all that delicious steam.

## Ingredients

- 1 whole chicken (4-5 pounds)
- 1 can Clarity Brewing Classic Pilsner
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons your favorite BBQ rub (or see our recipe below)

### Homemade BBQ Rub

- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon paprika
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne (optional)

## Instructions

### Prep the Chicken

1. Remove chicken from refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking
2. Pat completely dry with paper towels
3. Rub olive oil all over the skin
4. Apply BBQ rub liberally, including inside the cavity

### Prep the Beer

1. Open the can and pour out (or drink) about 1/4 of the beer
2. Add 1 tablespoon of your BBQ rub to the can
3. The beer will foam - this is normal

### Set Up the Grill

1. Heat grill to 350-375°F for indirect cooking
2. Place a drip pan under where the chicken will sit
3. For charcoal: bank coals on opposite sides

### Cook

1. Lower the chicken onto the beer can - it should stand upright
2. Tuck wing tips behind the back
3. Place on grill over drip pan
4. Close lid and cook 1-1.5 hours until internal temp reaches 165°F
5. Check thickest part of thigh with meat thermometer

### Rest and Serve

1. Carefully remove from grill (chicken and can are HOT)
2. Let rest 10 minutes before removing can
3. Carve and serve with your favorite sides

## Tips for Success

- **Don't skip the drying** - Wet skin won't crisp
- **Use a roasting rack** - Helps if your chicken wants to tip
- **Low and slow** - High heat will burn the skin before cooking through
- **Check for doneness** - Color isn't reliable; use a thermometer

## Pairing Suggestions

Serve with more Classic Pilsner for a complete summer meal. The crisp, clean beer cuts through the richness of the chicken perfectly.

## Leftovers

Leftover beer can chicken makes excellent:
- Chicken salad
- Tacos
- Sandwiches
- Soup base

Store in refrigerator up to 4 days.
