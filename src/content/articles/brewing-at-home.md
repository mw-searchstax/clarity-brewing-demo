## Yes, You Can Brew NA Beer at Home!

While commercial NA beer requires specialized equipment for dealcoholization, homebrewers can make excellent low-alcohol beer using the "restricted fermentation" method.

## What You'll Need

### Equipment
- 5-gallon brew kettle
- Fermenter with airlock
- Thermometer (crucial for this method!)
- Hydrometer
- Bottles or keg for serving
- Standard homebrewing supplies

### Ingredients (for 5 gallons)
- 6 lbs light malt extract
- 1 lb crystal malt (for flavor complexity)
- 1 oz Cascade hops (or your choice)
- 1 packet SafAle US-05 yeast
- Water

## The Restricted Fermentation Method

The key to low-alcohol homebrewing is controlling fermentation. Here's how:

### Step 1: Mash at High Temperature

If using all-grain, mash at 162°F (72°C) instead of the usual 152°F. This produces more unfermentable sugars that yeast can't convert to alcohol.

### Step 2: Boil as Normal

- Bring to a boil
- Add hops for bitterness at 60 minutes
- Add hops for flavor at 15 minutes
- Add hops for aroma at flameout

### Step 3: Cool Quickly

Chill wort to 65°F (18°C) as fast as possible. This is where your thermometer becomes critical.

### Step 4: Short Fermentation

Here's the secret:
1. Pitch yeast at 65°F
2. Let ferment for only 24-48 hours
3. **Pasteurize** to kill yeast and stop fermentation

### Step 5: Pasteurization

Heat the beer to 140°F (60°C) for 20 minutes. This kills the yeast without destroying flavor:
- Use a sous vide circulator in your fermenter
- Or heat in a large pot with careful temperature monitoring

### Step 6: Carbonate and Serve

Since yeast is dead, you can't bottle condition. Options:
- Force carbonate in a keg
- Add fresh yeast + priming sugar (will add minimal alcohol)
- Serve flat (some styles work this way)

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with a flavorful recipe** - low alcohol means you need more malt character
2. **Use high-quality ingredients** - flaws are more noticeable without alcohol
3. **Don't skip pasteurization** - or fermentation will continue in the bottle
4. **Be patient** - your first batch may need adjustments

## Our Favorite Beginner Recipe

**"Almost Zero" Amber Ale**
- 7 lbs amber malt extract (for extra body)
- 0.5 lb crystal 60L
- 1 oz Willamette hops (60 min)
- 0.5 oz Willamette hops (5 min)
- US-05 yeast
- Ferment 36 hours at 65°F

Expected ABV: 0.5-1.0%
