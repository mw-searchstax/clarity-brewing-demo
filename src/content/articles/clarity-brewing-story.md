## From Craft Beer Lovers to NA Pioneers

Clarity Brewing was born from a simple question: Why should choosing not to drink mean giving up great beer?

## The Founders' Story

In 2019, co-founders Jake Morrison and Priya Sharma were both working in the craft beer industry - Jake as a head brewer at a respected microbrewery, Priya as a beer sommelier and educator.

When Priya was diagnosed with a health condition requiring her to eliminate alcohol, she faced an unexpected loss: the craft beer culture she loved.

"The NA options at the time were terrible," Priya recalls. "Watery, flavorless, embarrassing to order. I felt excluded from an industry I'd helped build."

Jake saw an opportunity. "I kept thinking: we know how to make great beer. The dealcoholization technology exists. Why isn't anyone doing this right?"

## The First Brew

In Jake's garage in Austin, Texas, they started experimenting. Sixty-seven batches later, they had something special: a NA lager that actually tasted like craft beer.

"When we poured that first successful batch, we both knew. This was it. This could change everything."

That lager would become Golden Horizon, our flagship product.
