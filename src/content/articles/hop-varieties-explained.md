## Introduction to Hops

Hops are the flowers of *Humulus lupulus*, a climbing plant related to cannabis. They provide bitterness to balance malt sweetness, contribute aroma and flavor, and act as a natural preservative.

For non-alcoholic beer, hops are particularly important - they provide much of the flavor that distinguishes craft NA beer from bland alternatives.

## Understanding Hop Chemistry

### Alpha Acids

Alpha acids create bitterness when boiled. The percentage of alpha acids (AA%) determines bittering potential:
- **Low (2-5%):** Noble hops, delicate bitterness
- **Medium (5-10%):** Balanced bittering and aroma
- **High (10-18%):** Aggressive bittering hops

### Essential Oils

Essential oils provide aroma and flavor. Key oil compounds include:
- **Myrcene:** Herbal, resinous, green
- **Humulene:** Woody, spicy, earthy
- **Caryophyllene:** Peppery, woody
- **Linalool:** Floral, citrus
- **Geraniol:** Rose, floral

### Polyphenols

Polyphenols contribute to haze (in hazy IPAs) and provide subtle flavor complexity.

## Noble Hops

The four classic European varieties, prized for delicate, refined character.

### Saaz

**Origin:** Czech Republic
**Alpha Acids:** 2-5%
**Character:** Spicy, herbal, slightly floral

The defining hop of Bohemian pilsner. Delicate yet distinctive. We use Saaz in our Classic Pilsner.

### Hallertau Mittelfrüh

**Origin:** Germany
**Alpha Acids:** 3-5.5%
**Character:** Floral, slightly spicy, mild

Traditional German lager hop. Increasingly rare due to disease susceptibility.

### Tettnang

**Origin:** Germany
**Alpha Acids:** 3-5%
**Character:** Spicy, herbal, slightly floral

Similar to Saaz, often used in German wheat beers and lagers.

### Spalt

**Origin:** Germany
**Alpha Acids:** 3-5%
**Character:** Mild spice, subtle earth

The least known noble hop, used in specialty German styles.

## American Hops

The American craft beer revolution was built on bold, assertive hop varieties.

### Citra

**Origin:** Washington, USA (2008)
**Alpha Acids:** 11-13%

One of the most popular modern hops. Intensely tropical with citrus backbone. We use Citra extensively in our IPAs.

Dual-purpose English hop with more intensity than traditional varieties.

## Using Hops in Brewing

### Bittering Additions

Hops added early in the boil (60+ minutes) contribute primarily bitterness. Essential oils evaporate; only alpha acids remain.

### Flavor Additions

Mid-boil additions (15-30 minutes) balance bitterness and aroma. Some oils remain, some evaporate.

### Aroma Additions

Late additions (0-15 minutes) and whirlpool hops contribute maximum aroma with minimal bitterness.

### Dry Hopping

Post-fermentation additions provide intense aroma without any bitterness. Critical for modern IPAs.

## Hops in Non-Alcoholic Beer

The dealcoholization process can strip hop aromatics. We compensate through:

1. **Post-process dry hopping** - Adding hops after dealcoholization
2. **Hop oil additions** - Pure extracted hop oils
3. **Higher hopping rates** - Using more hops than traditional recipes
4. **Fresh, quality hops** - Sourcing the freshest possible hops

## Hop Selection at Clarity Brewing

We select hops based on:
- **Freshness** - Hops are agricultural products; fresher is better
- **Quality** - We source from top farms with strict quality control
- **Character** - Each variety brings specific flavors to specific beers
- **Consistency** - Crop-to-crop variation is minimized through careful sourcing

## Conclusion

Understanding hops opens a window into beer flavor. Whether you prefer the delicate spice of noble hops or the tropical punch of modern American varieties, there's a hop - and a Clarity Brewing beer - for you.
