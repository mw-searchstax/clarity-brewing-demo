## The Art and Science of NA Beer

Making great non-alcoholic beer is actually harder than making regular beer. We start with a full-flavored craft beer, then carefully remove the alcohol while preserving everything that makes beer delicious.

## Two Main Approaches

### 1. Dealcoholization Methods

Most NA beers, including ours at Clarity Brewing, start as regular beer and then have the alcohol removed:

**Vacuum Distillation**
- Beer is heated under reduced pressure (vacuum)
- Alcohol evaporates at lower temperatures (~35°C vs 78°C)
- Gentler process preserves more flavor compounds
- This is our primary method at Clarity Brewing

**Reverse Osmosis**
- Beer is pushed through a membrane that separates alcohol
- Very precise control over final ABV
- Can be combined with other methods

**Spinning Cone Column**
- Uses centrifugal force to separate alcohol
- Common in wine production, adapted for beer
- Excellent flavor preservation

### 2. Restricted Fermentation

Some brewers prevent alcohol from forming in the first place:

- Use special yeast strains that produce less alcohol
- Stop fermentation early before alcohol develops
- Often results in sweeter, less complex flavors

## How We Do It at Clarity Brewing

Our process combines traditional brewing with gentle dealcoholization:

1. **Brew a full-strength beer** using premium ingredients
2. **Complete fermentation** for maximum flavor development
3. **Vacuum distillation** at low temperature to remove alcohol
4. **Flavor restoration** - we re-add hop oils and aromatics lost during processing
5. **Quality control** - every batch tested for ABV, flavor, and consistency

## The 0.5% Question

You might notice our beers contain up to 0.5% ABV. Why not 0.0%?

Removing 100% of alcohol often removes too much flavor. The trace amount in 0.5% beer:
- Is less than many fruit juices and breads
- Cannot cause intoxication (you'd need 10+ beers in an hour)
- Allows for a much fuller flavor profile

## The Future of NA Beer

The NA beer market is the fastest-growing segment in craft brewing. New techniques are constantly emerging, and we're committed to staying at the forefront of innovation while never compromising on flavor.
