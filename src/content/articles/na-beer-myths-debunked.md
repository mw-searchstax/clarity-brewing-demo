## Setting the Record Straight

Non-alcoholic beer has come a long way, but myths persist. Let's separate fact from fiction.

### Myth 1: "NA Beer Has No Alcohol"

**Reality:** Most NA beers contain up to 0.5% ABV. This is less than many fruit juices (orange juice can reach 0.5%) and ripe bananas. You'd need to drink about 10 NA beers in an hour to match one regular beer.

### Myth 2: "It Tastes Like Water"

**Reality:** Modern NA beers use advanced brewing and dealcoholization techniques that preserve flavor. Blind taste tests regularly show people can't distinguish quality NA beers from their alcoholic counterparts.

### Myth 3: "It's Just for Recovering Alcoholics"

**Reality:** The NA beer market is driven primarily by health-conscious consumers, designated drivers, athletes, and people who simply want to enjoy beer without alcohol's effects. It's a lifestyle choice, not just a medical one.

### Myth 4: "NA Beer Will Get You Drunk If You Drink Enough"

**Reality:** Your body processes the tiny amount of alcohol faster than you can consume it. It's physically impossible to get drunk on 0.5% beer - you'd experience water intoxication first.

### Myth 5: "It's Full of Sugar"

**Reality:** Most NA beers have similar or even lower calories than regular beer. Our lightest option, Citrus Radler, has just 35 calories. Check the labels - you might be surprised.

### Myth 6: "It's New and Untested"

**Reality:** Low-alcohol beers have existed for centuries. German "small beer" was a daily staple in medieval times. Modern NA beer simply applies better technology to an age-old concept.

### Myth 7: "Pregnant Women Can't Have It"

**Reality:** This is genuinely complicated. While 0.5% ABV is lower than many foods pregnant women eat, medical guidance varies by country. Consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice.

## The Bottom Line

NA beer is a legitimate beverage category that has earned its place. Don't let outdated myths keep you from trying something that might become your new favorite.
