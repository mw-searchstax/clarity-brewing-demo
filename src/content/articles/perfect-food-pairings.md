## Beer Pairing 101

The same principles that guide wine pairing apply to beer - but beer's carbonation, bitterness, and malt character open up even more possibilities. Here's how to match our NA beers with your favorite foods.

## Pairing Principles

### Complement or Contrast

- **Complement:** Match similar flavors (chocolate stout with chocolate dessert)
- **Contrast:** Balance opposing flavors (hoppy IPA with rich, fatty foods)

### Consider Intensity

Light beers with light dishes, bold beers with bold flavors. You wouldn't pair a delicate salad with Midnight Stout!

## Our Beers, Your Meals

### Golden Horizon Lager

**Best with:** Light, fresh dishes
- Grilled fish with lemon
- Caesar salad
- Sushi and sashimi
- Mild chicken dishes
- Fresh oysters

**Why it works:** The clean, crisp character cleanses the palate without overwhelming delicate flavors.

### Pacific Haze IPA

**Best with:** Spicy and bold flavors
- Thai curry
- Buffalo wings
- Fish tacos with mango salsa
- Jerk chicken
- Strong cheeses

**Why it works:** Tropical hop character complements heat and spice, while bitterness cuts through richness.

### Midnight Stout

**Best with:** Rich, indulgent foods
- Chocolate desserts
- BBQ brisket
- Oysters (surprisingly!)
- Aged cheddar
- Coffee-rubbed steak

**Why it works:** Roasted flavors echo grilled and caramelized notes. Chocolate and coffee are natural partners.

### Summer Wheat

**Best with:** Brunch and light fare
- Eggs Benedict
- Fresh fruit
- Light salads with citrus
- Weisswurst and pretzels
- Mild seafood

**Why it works:** Fruity esters complement breakfast flavors; wheat character loves lighter proteins.

### Copper Trail Amber

**Best with:** Comfort food classics
- BBQ ribs
- Burgers and fries
- Roasted chicken
- Grilled vegetables
- Hearty soups and stews

**Why it works:** Caramel malt character bridges savory and sweet, making it incredibly versatile.

## Pro Tips

1. **Serve at proper temperature** - too cold and you lose flavor nuance
2. **Consider the sauce** - pair with the dominant flavor, not just the protein
3. **Don't overthink it** - if it tastes good to you, it's a good pairing!
