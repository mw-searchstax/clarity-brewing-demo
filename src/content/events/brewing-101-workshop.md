## Learn to Brew - For Free

Always wanted to try homebrewing but didn't know where to start? This free workshop covers everything you need to begin your brewing journey.

## What You'll Learn

- **Basic ingredients** - Malt, hops, yeast, water
- **The brewing process** - Mashing, boiling, fermenting
- **Equipment overview** - What you need to get started
- **Your first recipe** - A simple pale ale anyone can make
- **Common mistakes** - And how to avoid them

## Hands-On Demonstration

Watch our brewing team create a small batch from start to finish. Ask questions as we go.

## Take-Home Materials

Every attendee receives:
- Beginner's brewing guide (printed)
- Recipe sheet for your first batch
- List of local homebrew supply shops
