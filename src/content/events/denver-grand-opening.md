## Clarity Brewing Comes to Colorado

After months of build-out, we're thrilled to announce the grand opening of our Denver taproom! Join us for a day of celebration, free tastings, and the debut of two Colorado-exclusive beers.

## Free Event Highlights

This is a **free community event** - no tickets required! Just show up and enjoy:

- **Free tastings** of our complete beer lineup
- **Live music** from Colorado artists
- **Food trucks** (pay as you go)
- **Brewery tours** of our new facility
- **Giveaways** throughout the day
- **First 100 guests** receive a free Clarity Brewing t-shirt

## Colorado-Exclusive Debuts

We're launching two beers you can only get at our Denver location:

### Rocky Mountain Crisp

A refreshing pilsner brewed with Colorado spring water and locally-sourced honey. Light, clean, and perfect for the Denver sunshine.

### Mile High Pale Ale

Our take on the Colorado pale ale tradition. Citrus-forward with a backbone of Colorado malts. Sessionable and satisfying.

These beers are **only available in Denver** - a thank-you to our Colorado community.
