## Brew Your Own NA Beer

Ever wanted to make your own non-alcoholic craft beer? This hands-on workshop teaches you everything you need to know to start brewing at home.

## What You'll Learn

- **Equipment essentials** - What you really need (and what you don't)
- **The restricted fermentation method** - How to keep ABV low naturally
- **Recipe formulation** - Designing beers with big flavor at low alcohol
- **Pasteurization techniques** - Stopping fermentation safely
- **Troubleshooting** - Common problems and how to fix them

## Hands-On Experience

This isn't a lecture - you'll actually brew! Each participant will:

1. Help mash and sparge a 5-gallon batch
2. Add hops at different stages
3. Learn to use hydrometers and thermometers
4. Take home a detailed recipe book
5. Receive a sample of the beer we brew together (shipped after fermentation)

## Who Should Attend

- Complete beginners curious about homebrewing
- Experienced homebrewers new to NA brewing
- Anyone who wants to understand the craft better
- Home cooks looking for a new hobby

No experience necessary! We'll cover everything from scratch.
