## The Perfect Valentine's Date

Forget the crowded restaurants and prix fixe menus. This Valentine's Day, treat your special someone (or yourself!) to an evening of chocolate and craft beer.

- How terroir affects both chocolate and coffee
- Porter served at cellar temperature

### Course 2: Inclusions

### Course 3: Texture Play

- 70% dark chocolate
- Milk chocolate
- Finding your sweet spot

### Course 5: The Surprise
