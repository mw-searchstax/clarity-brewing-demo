## About Belgian Tripel

Belgian Tripel demonstrates that non-alcoholic beer can achieve remarkable complexity. Using authentic Belgian yeast and traditional techniques, we've created a beer with the signature spicy, fruity character of the great Trappist ales.

### Tasting Notes

- **Aroma:** Banana, clove, white pepper, pear, with subtle honey notes
- **Taste:** Complex interplay of fruit esters (banana, apple, pear) and spicy phenols (clove, pepper, subtle coriander)
- **Finish:** Remarkably dry and crisp, encouraging another sip

### Belgian Yeast Magic

The character of a tripel comes almost entirely from the yeast. We use an authentic Belgian abbey strain that produces:
- **Fruity Esters** - Banana, pear, apple from high-temperature fermentation
- **Spicy Phenols** - Clove, pepper, vanilla from specialized yeast enzymes

We ferment warm (72-78°F) to encourage ester production, then crash cool to preserve these delicate aromatics before dealcoholization.

### Simple Grain, Complex Beer

Traditional tripels use very simple grain bills - the complexity comes from fermentation:
- **Belgian Pilsner Malt** - Light, bready, clean
- **Light Candi Sugar** - Ferments completely dry, adds subtle honey notes

### Perfect Pairings

Belgian beers are remarkably food-friendly:
- Mussels in white wine sauce
- Roast chicken with herbs
- Creamy cheeses like Brie or Camembert
- Light fruit desserts
- Thai cuisine (the spice complements spicy food)

Available in 4-packs and on tap at select taprooms.
