## About Breakfast Stout

Breakfast Stout is our most decadent creation. Inspired by the ultimate comfort breakfast, this beer combines silky oatmeal body, rich coffee, dark chocolate, and a whisper of Vermont maple syrup.

### Tasting Notes

- **Aroma:** Fresh brewed coffee, maple pancakes, cocoa powder
- **Taste:** Lush and creamy with layers of espresso, oatmeal sweetness, and dark chocolate
- **Finish:** Long and satisfying with subtle maple warmth and roasted grain

### Premium Ingredients

We spare no expense on Breakfast Stout:
- **Cold-brew coffee** from local roasters, steeped for 48 hours
- **Rolled oats** comprising 15% of the grain bill for silky texture
- **Grade A Vermont maple syrup** added post-fermentation
- **Cocoa nibs** from single-origin Ecuadorian cacao

### The Oatmeal Difference

Most stouts feel thin when dealcoholized - the oats fix that. Flaked and rolled oats contribute body, sweetness, and a creamy mouthfeel that rivals full-strength imperial stouts.

### Serving Suggestions

Serve at 55°F (13°C) in a snifter or tulip glass. This beer shines on its own but also works beautifully as a dessert pairing or actual breakfast beer.

Try it with:
- Chocolate croissants
- Maple bacon
- Tiramisu
- Aged gouda with honeycomb

### Why $18.99?

Breakfast Stout uses premium ingredients that cost significantly more than our standard beers. The cold-brew coffee, Vermont maple syrup, and extended conditioning time all add up - but we think you'll taste the difference.

Available in 4-packs and on nitro tap at all taprooms.
