- **Finish:** Clean and dry with lingering citrus brightness

### Light & Refreshing

At just 35 calories and 0.3% ABV, Citrus Radler is our lightest offering. It's practically a sparkling citrus water that happens to taste like beer.

No artificial flavors here - we use fresh-pressed grapefruit and lemon juice from California citrus, added after dealcoholization to preserve fresh fruit character.

### Perfect For
