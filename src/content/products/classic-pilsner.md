## About Classic Pilsner

Our Classic Pilsner pays homage to the original Bohemian style that revolutionized beer. We use traditional Saaz hops for authentic floral and spicy notes, balanced by premium Czech malts.

### Tasting Notes

- **Aroma:** Delicate floral hops with hints of fresh bread
- **Taste:** Crisp, clean malt character with gentle bitterness
- **Finish:** Dry and refreshing with lingering hop spice

### Brewing Process

Classic Pilsner requires the most precise brewing of all our beers. We use a triple-decoction mash to develop the subtle malt complexity, then cold-lager for six weeks before dealcoholization.

### Perfect Pairings

The clean profile complements:
- Grilled chicken or fish
- Light salads with vinaigrette
- Soft cheeses like brie
- Seafood, especially shrimp and oysters

### When to Enjoy

This is your go-to beer for hot summer days, casual gatherings, or anytime you want something refreshing without overwhelming flavors. The ultimate lawnmower beer.

Available in 6-packs and on tap at all taprooms.
