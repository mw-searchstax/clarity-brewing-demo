## About Copper Trail Amber

Copper Trail is our crowd-pleaser - an amber ale that bridges the gap between light lagers and bold craft styles. The beautiful copper color hints at the rich malt flavors within.

### Tasting Notes

- **Aroma:** Warm caramel and toasted bread
- **Taste:** Sweet malt upfront, balanced by gentle hop bitterness
- **Finish:** Clean with lingering toffee notes

### The Malt Story

We use a complex grain bill to achieve Copper Trail's signature flavor:
- **Munich Malt** - Provides the rich amber color
- **Crystal Malt** - Adds caramel sweetness
- **Victory Malt** - Contributes toasty, biscuit notes

### Perfect Pairings

Copper Trail's balanced profile makes it extremely food-friendly:
- BBQ ribs and pulled pork
- Roasted root vegetables
- Hearty stews and chili
- Aged gouda or gruyère

### For Beer Beginners

If you're new to craft beer (or NA craft beer), Copper Trail is the perfect starting point. It's flavorful enough to be interesting but approachable enough for any palate.

### Availability

Copper Trail is available year-round in 6-packs and 12-packs, and on tap at all our taproom locations.
