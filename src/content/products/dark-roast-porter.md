## About Dark Roast Porter

Dark Roast Porter is our love letter to coffee lovers who also appreciate great beer. We partnered with Austin's own Cuvée Coffee to source single-origin Ethiopian beans that we add during conditioning, creating layers of coffee complexity without any bitterness.

### Tasting Notes

- **Aroma:** Fresh espresso, dark chocolate, hints of vanilla and caramel
- **Taste:** Rich and full-bodied with waves of roasted malt, baker's chocolate, and coffee
- **Finish:** Smooth and lingering with subtle roast character and a clean, dry ending

### The Coffee Story

We experimented with over 20 different coffee varieties before settling on a natural-process Ethiopian Guji. The fruity undertones of this coffee complement the chocolate malt perfectly, while the natural processing adds subtle wine-like notes.

The beans are cold-steeped for 24 hours and added post-fermentation to preserve delicate aromatics while avoiding harsh, bitter extraction.

### Malt Profile

Dark Roast Porter gets its complexity from a carefully layered malt bill:
- **Maris Otter** - English base malt for biscuit backbone
- **Chocolate Malt** - Deep cocoa notes
- **Crystal 120** - Toffee and dark fruit
- **Carafa Special III** - Smooth roast without astringency
- **Flaked Oats** - Silky mouthfeel

### Food Pairings

The rich flavors stand up to bold foods:
- Barbecue brisket with sweet, smoky sauce
- Dark chocolate desserts (70% cacao or higher)
- Aged cheddar or gouda
- Mushroom-based dishes
- Vanilla ice cream (try a float!)

### Serving Suggestions

Best enjoyed at 50-55°F (10-13°C) - slightly warmer than typical to let the aromatics shine. Pour into a tulip glass or English pint.

This beer is exceptional with brunch, making it perfect for weekend mornings or as an afternoon pick-me-up without the caffeine crash.

Available in 4-packs, 6-packs, and on nitro tap at select taprooms.
