## About Double Dry-Hopped IPA

If you think non-alcoholic beer can't deliver serious hop punch, DDH IPA is here to change your mind. We use over 4 pounds of hops per barrel - double our standard IPA - creating the most aromatic, flavorful hop bomb we've ever produced.

### Tasting Notes

- **Aroma:** Absolutely explosive - ripe mango, fresh cannabis, pine resin, tangerine, and a whiff of coconut
- **Taste:** Incredibly juicy with waves of tropical fruit, stone fruit, and citrus. Soft, pillowy mouthfeel with no harsh bitterness.
- **Finish:** Long, fruity, and resinous with subtle dankness that invites another sip

### The Double Dry-Hop Process

Most IPAs are dry-hopped once. We do it twice:

**First Addition (Day 3 of Fermentation)**
The first dry-hop goes in while yeast is still active. This biotransformation process creates unique fruity esters and helps lock in hop oils that would otherwise dissipate.

**Second Addition (Post-Fermentation)**
After fermentation completes, we add a second massive dose of hops. This addition provides fresh, vibrant aromatics that haven't been modified by yeast activity.

### Hop Lineup

We use six different hop varieties, each selected for specific characteristics:

| Hop | Origin | Character |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| Citra | USA | Grapefruit, tropical, lime |
| Mosaic | USA | Blueberry, mango, earthy |
| Galaxy | Australia | Passionfruit, citrus, peach |
| Nelson Sauvin | New Zealand | White wine, gooseberry |
| Simcoe | USA | Pine, dank, citrus |
| Strata | USA | Cannabis, tropical, passionfruit |

### Water Chemistry

Hop-forward beers require specific water chemistry. We adjust our water to match the mineral profile of the Pacific Northwest - high sulfates to accentuate hop bitterness and flavor, low chlorides to keep the beer crisp rather than sweet.

### The Soft Body Secret

That pillowy, creamy mouthfeel comes from our grain bill:
- **Flaked Oats (12%)** - Adds body and silkiness
- **Flaked Wheat (8%)** - Contributes protein haze and creaminess
- **Honey Malt (3%)** - Subtle sweetness without caramel

This combination creates a soft, almost smoothie-like texture that carries the hop oils beautifully.

### Haze Stability

The haze in DDH IPA is permanent - it won't settle out over time. This comes from the protein-polyphenol interactions between the wheat/oat proteins and hop polyphenols. It's not a flaw; it's intentional and delicious.

### Freshness Matters

Hops are volatile. The incredible aromatics in DDH IPA will fade over time. We date every can and recommend consuming within 60 days of packaging. Check the bottom of the can for the "packaged on" date.

### Storage Tips

- Keep refrigerated (38-40°F / 3-4°C)
- Store upright to minimize oxidation
- Never leave in sunlight or warm car
- Don't age this beer - drink it fresh!

### Food Pairings

The intense hop character requires bold food partners:
- Spicy Thai curries (green or red)
- Jerk chicken or pork
- Blue cheese burgers
- Mango habanero wings
- Strong, washed-rind cheeses

### Serving Suggestions

Pour into a wide-mouth glass (teku, tulip, or even a stemless wine glass) to maximize aroma exposure. Serve at 45-50°F (7-10°C) - too cold and you'll mute the aromatics.
