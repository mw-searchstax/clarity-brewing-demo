## About Golden Horizon

Golden Horizon is our flagship lager, crafted using traditional German brewing techniques with a modern NA twist. We use a proprietary dealcoholization process that preserves the full flavor profile while keeping the ABV at just 0.5%.

### Tasting Notes

- **Aroma:** Fresh citrus zest with hints of honey
- **Taste:** Clean, crisp malt character with a subtle hop bitterness
- **Finish:** Refreshingly dry with lingering citrus

### Perfect Pairings

This versatile lager pairs beautifully with:
- Grilled chicken or fish
- Light salads with citrus dressing
- Mild cheeses like mozzarella or gouda
- Spicy Mexican cuisine

### Brewing Process

Golden Horizon is brewed with 100% malted barley, noble hops, and our proprietary yeast strain. After primary fermentation, we use a gentle vacuum distillation process to remove alcohol while preserving delicate flavor compounds.

Available in 6-packs and 12-packs at select retailers.
