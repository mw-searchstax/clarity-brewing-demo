## About Midnight Stout

For those who believe NA beer can't deliver bold, complex flavors, Midnight Stout is here to change your mind. This full-bodied stout brings everything you love about craft stouts without the alcohol.

### Tasting Notes

- **Aroma:** Rich espresso with dark chocolate undertones
- **Taste:** Velvety smooth with roasted malt, baker's chocolate, and a hint of vanilla
- **Finish:** Long, satisfying finish with lingering coffee notes

### Perfect Pairings

Midnight Stout is a dessert lover's dream:
- Chocolate cake or brownies
- Tiramisu
- Aged cheddar or blue cheese
- Grilled red meat with mushroom sauce

### Awards

- **Gold Medal** - International NA Beer Awards 2024
- **Best Stout** - Craft Beverage Expo 2024

### Brewing Process

We use a blend of roasted barley, chocolate malt, and a touch of oats for creaminess. Cold extraction of coffee beans adds depth without bitterness. The result is a stout that stands up to any full-strength craft beer.

Available in 4-packs at select retailers and at our taprooms.
