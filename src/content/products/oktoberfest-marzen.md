## About Oktoberfest Märzen

Our Oktoberfest Märzen celebrates the great German brewing tradition. Brewed in spring and lagered through summer, this beer captures the essence of Munich's famous festival.

### Tasting Notes

- **Aroma:** Fresh baked bread, honey, light toffee
- **Taste:** Rich Munich malt sweetness balanced by subtle noble hop bitterness
- **Finish:** Clean and dry, inviting another sip

### Brewing Tradition

Märzen means "March beer" - historically brewed in March before the warm summer months when brewing was impossible. We honor this tradition by brewing our batch each spring and cold-lagering for five months.

### Malt Forward

Unlike hoppy American styles, Märzen is all about the malt:
- **Munich Malt** - The star of the show, providing rich bread and honey notes
- **Vienna Malt** - Adds complexity and light biscuit character
- **Melanoidin Malt** - Intensifies malt depth

### Perfect Pairings

Traditional Oktoberfest fare works beautifully:
- Bratwurst with sauerkraut
- Soft pretzels with mustard
- Roast pork or chicken
- Aged Alpine cheeses
