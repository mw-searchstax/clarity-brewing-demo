## About Pacific Haze IPA

Pacific Haze is our answer to the hazy IPA revolution. We've captured the juicy, tropical character that IPA lovers crave while keeping it completely sessionable at 0.5% ABV.

### Tasting Notes

- **Aroma:** Explosive tropical fruit - mango, passionfruit, guava
- **Taste:** Soft, pillowy mouthfeel with layers of citrus and stone fruit
- **Finish:** Smooth with minimal bitterness, just pure hop flavor

### Hop Profile

Pacific Haze features a carefully curated hop blend:
- **Citra** - Grapefruit and tropical fruit
- **Mosaic** - Blueberry and mango
- **Galaxy** - Passionfruit and citrus

We use a late-addition and dry-hopping technique to maximize aroma while minimizing harsh bitterness.

### Perfect Pairings

The tropical notes complement:
- Spicy Thai or Indian cuisine
- Fish tacos with mango salsa
- Strong, funky cheeses
- Fresh ceviche

### Why Hazy?

The haze comes from suspended proteins and hop particles - it's not a flaw, it's a feature! This gives Pacific Haze its signature soft, creamy mouthfeel.

Available in 6-packs nationwide and on tap at our taprooms.
