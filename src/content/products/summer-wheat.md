## About Summer Wheat

Inspired by centuries of German brewing tradition, Summer Wheat brings authentic hefeweizen character to the NA category. Our special yeast strain produces the classic banana and clove esters that define the style.

### Tasting Notes

- **Aroma:** Fresh banana bread with subtle clove spice
- **Taste:** Soft wheat character with fruity esters and a hint of vanilla
- **Finish:** Clean and refreshing with lingering spice

### Traditional Technique

We follow the Reinheitsgebot (German Beer Purity Law) principles:
- 50% malted wheat, 50% malted barley
- German noble hops
- Authentic Bavarian hefeweizen yeast

The cloudy appearance is traditional - it comes from suspended yeast and wheat proteins.

### Perfect Pairings

Summer Wheat is incredibly versatile:
- Weisswurst and pretzels (classic!)
- Fresh fruit and berries
- Light seafood dishes
- Brunch favorites like eggs Benedict

### Serving Suggestion

Pour into a traditional weizen glass at 45°F (7°C). The tall glass showcases the beautiful cloudy appearance and helps release the banana and clove aromas.

Available April through September in 6-packs.
